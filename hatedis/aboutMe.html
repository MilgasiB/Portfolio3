		<p id="text">Hey. <br /> My name is Benjamin Eekenulv and I'm 18 years old, soon to be 19. I was born the 29th of august 1995 and was an only child until four years later when my brother Gabriel was born. The only expandation of the family since then was when we bought our cat, Felix. Oh and we had two hamsters during the period of a month. I started my line of studying in a little school called Bagaregårdsskolan where I studied for 6 years (year 0-5).In year 4 at Bagaregårdsskolan I started playing the piano. After that I took the music/orchestra program at a school called Nya Lunden for four years (year 6-9) which then ended up in me studying music for a year at Hvitfeldtska Gymnasium in Gothenbourgh. After a lot of thought I then reconciled with the thought of music not being the right path for me to thread, which led me to where I am now, at the engineering program of NTI-Gymnasiet, and I couldn't be happier! </br> Random facts: I play a lot of computer games (such as D3, LoL, SolForge). I've always been fascinated by mathematics. I have a girlfriend named Sofia whom I've been with since 19th of november 2012. In LoL, I got to the rank of Diamond after only playing the game for 9 months. I played a lot of warcraft 3 when I was younger and was one of the best amateur ladder players in Sweden.</p>
